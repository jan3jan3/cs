The project is about locality sensitive hashing. 
Aim is to find duplicates in a television screen dataset without using modelID
use titlepage LSH and classification instead

Methods are on the second half of the code
There are methods for
- creating signature matrix
- LSH
- extract candidate pairs from buckets
- bootstrapping
- Logistic regressions
- pair quality, pair completeness and F1 measures

Methods are implemented in the first half of the codes in steps
- extract title words 
- create signature matrix
- minhashing
- LSH
- classification using logistic regression
